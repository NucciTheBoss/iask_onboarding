# Overview
This repository contains all the material that I need for the Spring 2021 semester i-ASK onboarding sessions. This repository has powerpoints, source code, and container defintion files for the sessions I am leading. The main points that I am covering are the following:

* General tools for the i-ASK center
* Singularity
* Docker
* Anaconda

In my opinion, these are the biggest topics that need to be covered in the i-ASK center. There are so many great, free tools out there that can be used to help improve your workflow, and Singularity and Docker are vital tools for delivering software to users on the cluster. Anaconda is the glue that I use to grab all the dependencies that I could possibly need!

# Presentations

* **Day 1:** Level up your workflow!

  * This presentation is to help you discover all the amazing tools that you have available to you. Whether it's an SSH client or user-level package manager, this presentation has you covered. Also, at the end I also recommend some great books that serve as a great point of reference should you forget anything.

* **Day 2:** Use Singularity and Docker to build and deploy software!

  * Ever had to install a lot of packages, but you just don't have the system-level dependencies available to you? Well this tutorial has you covered! Learn how to build a Singularity container from scratch! Learn how to build a Docker Container, and then covert it to a Singularity image!
